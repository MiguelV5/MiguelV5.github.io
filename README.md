Personal portfolio webpage to display a little bit about myself, and some projects I've made along my career.

I also took this oportunity to learn a bit more about front-end js frameworks. In particular this site uses:

- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)
- [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)
- [Skeleton UI](https://www.skeleton.dev/)
