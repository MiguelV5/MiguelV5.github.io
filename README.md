Personal portfolio webpage to display a little bit about myself, and some projects I've done whilst studying my college degree.

I also took this as an opportunity to learn a tad more about front-end JS frameworks. Particularly this site uses:

- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)
- [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)
- [Skeleton UI](https://www.skeleton.dev/)
